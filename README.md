## Future work
- `SearchBar` support.
- Orientation-change support.
- Dismiss keyboard on iOS when tapping outside the keyboard (configurable). 
- Auto-scroll the view if the keyboard overlaps the text field.
- Modal support on Android (currently you can't use the toolbar in a modal because the toolbar is behind the modal)
